# Qt Application Packaging with Flatpak

This guide helps you package and deploy your Qt application as a Flatpak from a Windows environment using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following set up on your machine:
- **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with a compatible Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
- **Qt** project ready for deployment.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Flatpak and Flatpak-Builder

1. **Install Flatpak:**
   - Run the following commands in your WSL terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install flatpak
     ```

2. **Add Flathub Repository (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Add the Flathub repository to get access to a wide range of applications:
     ```bash
     sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
     ```

3. **Install Flatpak-Builder:**
   - Install Flatpak-Builder, a tool required to build Flatpak packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install flatpak-builder
     ```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Qt Application

1. **Move Your Application to WSL:**
   - Copy your Qt project files from Windows to a directory in WSL. You can access your Windows files in WSL under `/mnt/c/`.

2. **Install Qt and Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Qt packages inside WSL:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install qt5-default
     ```
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.

3. **Build Your Application:**
   - Navigate to your project directory and run the following commands:
     ```bash
     qmake
     make
     ```

### Step 3: Create a Flatpak Manifest

1. **Create a Manifest File:**
   - In your project directory, create a JSON file (e.g., `com.example.MyApp.json`) with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "com.example.MyApp",
       "runtime": "org.kde.Platform",
       "runtime-version": "5.15",
       "sdk": "org.kde.Sdk",
       "command": "myapp",
       "modules": [
         {
           "name": "myapp",
           "buildsystem": "qmake",
           "sources": [
             {
               "type": "dir",
               "path": "."
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Edit the Manifest:**
   - Replace `"myapp"` with the actual name of your executable.
   - Ensure the `runtime`, `sdk`, and other settings match your application's requirements.

### Step 4: Build the Flatpak Package

1. **Build with Flatpak-Builder:**
   - Run the following command in your project directory to build the Flatpak:
     ```bash
     flatpak-builder --repo=repo build-dir com.example.MyApp.json
     ```
   - This command creates a repository (`repo`) and builds the package in the `build-dir`.

2. **Export and Test the Flatpak:**
   - Export the built application as a Flatpak bundle:
     ```bash
     flatpak build-bundle repo MyApp.flatpak com.example.MyApp
     ```
   - Test the Flatpak by installing it locally:
     ```bash
     flatpak install MyApp.flatpak
     flatpak run com.example.MyApp
     ```

### Additional Tips

- **Debugging:**
  - If you encounter issues during the build process, use the `flatpak-builder --verbose` flag to get detailed output.
  
- **Continuous Integration:**
  - Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate Flatpak builds.
